# Weather Analysis - Python, NumPy
## Analysis of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) datasets in an attempt to master python libraries and functions

#### My primary objective was to practice automated python scripts and user-defined functions in order to simplify data cleaning and wrangling tasks.

SUMMARY  -

1. Used standard libraries for statistical analyses of factors such as temperature, rainfall, wind, etc.
2. Treatment of missing values - Substitution and Interpolation.
3. Created custom functions to extract arrays of necessary parameters using NumPy.
4. Created plots, charts, maps and visualizations.
5. Created custom function to perform exponential smoothing.

I have added markdowns, headings, and comments in my code to make it easy to understand.

I had a lot of fun while writing this code, and I hope this can be helpful to whoever may come across it.
Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or suggestions you may have.
